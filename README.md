# StepInverter
These are the Files and Tools for my Step Inverter based on Tony's (WarpSpeed) designs and ideas.
You'll find me, "MackOffGrid" and Tony, "WarpSpeed" on https://www.thebackshed.com/forum/forum_topics.asp?FID=4 

Please keep in mind that the spreadsheet, software and schematics are not polished for public consumption, I created them for myself to get the job done.
